      <h1 class="h1">About</h1>
      <p class="lead">I believe organizations succeed when clarity and execution come together. Most companies know where they want to go, but culture, systems, and daily operations often pull in different directions. My work begins with understanding how people, processes, and technology interact. I look at culture as much as workflow, and at leadership intent as much as frontline realities.</p>
      <p>The goal is not theory for its own sake but practical improvement. I use research-driven methods to uncover the root causes of friction, waste, or risk, and then design systems that people can actually use. Every recommendation is grounded in real-world experience, tested against operational constraints, and tailored to your environment. The result is an approach that creates momentum without losing sight of long-term purpose.</p>

            <h3>Self Determination Theory</h3>
            <p>A philosophy tested across domains. My academic focus on autonomous safety systems applies to organizational outcomes. In the workplace I focus on how human motivation thrives on competence, discipline, and relatedness, not hype. Training for and completing a marathon reinforced the same truth in fitness and coaching. Approaching obstacles through that lens helps move beyond enthusiasm to durable change.</p>

            <h3>Process Design</h3>
            <p>What mattered most seeking my Guinness World Record was not the 9.76 seconds of Lego stacking, but the discipline to make it official: organizing witnesses, producing evidence, building relationships, and meticulous documentation. Results depend on preparation, structure, and persistence as much as the final execution.</p>
