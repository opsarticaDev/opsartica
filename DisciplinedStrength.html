        <h2>Why Disciplined Strength</h2>
        <p>Exercise doesn't need hype. Show up, do the work, and stack small wins. I built a framework that works when motivation disappears. These programs are for real people, real jobs, and a real life that provides a constant stream of reasons to not take care of themselves first.</p>
        <ul class="key-points">
          <li>Competence: Learn how to tailor and measure progress. Each session builds confidence and skill.</li>
          <li>Autonomy: Bodyweight-first plans you can run anywhere, no fancy gear.</li>
          <li>Relatedness: Connect strength to something greater. Work. Family. Service.</li>

        <h2>About the Founder</h2>
        <p>I used to rely on motivation. Some days it even showed up. I broke free when I learned how to train with purpose. I bring psychology, systems engineering, and fitness together. I helped shape national safety standards. I built programs that saved millions and protected workers across industries.</p>
        <p>Disciplined Strength is how I live that same mission in fitness. I train to serve, to work, to lead, and to endure. This program is not about hype. It is about building strength that stays. Disciplined Strength is the practical, scalable fitness arm of the OpsArtica philosophy.</p>
